# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with LangChain

Welcome to the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Tutorial Repository! This repository contains a Python notebook designed to demonstrate how to implement RAG using LangChain. This approach combines document retrieval with generative AI to provide enhanced responses based on a large corpus of documents.

## Contents

The notebook includes step-by-step instructions and code examples for the following tasks:

1. **Uploading the File to Google Drive**: Instructions on how to upload your document file to Google Drive to make it accessible for processing.
   
2. **Installing Required LangChain Packages**: Steps to install the necessary LangChain packages and dependencies.

3. **API Key and Endpoint Configuration**: Guidance on setting up your API key and endpoint to connect with the LangChain service.

4. **Specifying the File Path and Document Loader**: Instructions on how to specify the file path in Google Drive and load the document into the notebook.

5. **Using a Text Splitter for Chunking**: Demonstrations on how to use a text splitter to chunk the document into manageable pieces for processing.

6. **Open Source Embeddings**: Information on selecting and using open source embeddings to convert text chunks into vector representations.

7. **Using ChromaDB for Storing Embeddings**: Steps to set up ChromaDB for storing and managing the embeddings.

8. **Querying and Similarity Search**: Examples of how to perform queries and similarity searches on the stored embeddings to retrieve relevant information.

## Prerequisites

- **Python**: Ensure you have Python installed. This tutorial is compatible with Python 3.6 and above.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Make sure you have Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install it via Anaconda or pip.
- **LangChain API Key**: Obtain an API key and endpoint from the LangChain service.
- **Google Drive**: Upload the document file to your Google Drive account.
